  * Open Source: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
  
## DBMS Functions
* All access to data is `centralized and managed` by the DBMS
* Use advantages:
  * Efficient access
  * Data integrity and security
  * Concurrent access and Concurrency control
* Design and implementation advantages:
  * Logical data independence
  * Physical data independence
  * **Reduced application development time**

## Current Market
* Relational Database still anchor the software industry
* Open Source "NoSQL" is growing
  * Analytics: Hadoop MapReduce, Spark
  * Key-Value Stores: Mongo, Cassandra, Couch
* Cloud Services are expanding quickly

## Course Objectives:
