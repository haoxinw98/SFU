## Chapter3: Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

### Section 3.1 Introduction to ODEs

For modelling biological processes (e.g. the recovery of infected individuals), ODEs are extremely useful

- transparent for complicated biological systems
- an enormously powerful mathematical theory available, which includes explicit solutions, approximate solutions, numerical solutions, qualitative behavior, and the theory of dynamical systems

**The essential advantage of mathematical modeling is the possibility of abstraction**

- For example, no matter whether $x(t)$ describes a growing fish population, a growing tumor, or the increase in infected individuals. To understand following equation: $$x'(t) = 2x(t)$$ is just the equation for exponential growth which can be treated and solved without referring to the interpretation at hand

An ODE is an equation for an unknown function and some of its derivatives

- A solution is also a function which satisfies the differential equation

#### Interpretation

An ODE for an unknown function $x(t)$ $$x'(t) = f(x(t),t)$$

- The Left-hand Side, $x'(t)$ describes the `rate of change` of the quantity $x(t)$ over time.
- The Right-hand Side, $f(x(t),t)$ describes `all sources of change` in $x(t)$

To solve a ODE means to use `local information` (" What happens next? ") to deduce `long-time behavior` ("What happens in the future? ")

### Section 3.2 Scalar Equation

For scalar equations of the first order:$$x'(t) = f(x(t),t)$$

- $x(t)$ is a `scalar function` and the equation involves first-order derivatives
  - If the function $f(x,t)$ does not depends on t, we call the equation `autonomous`, the above equation will be $$x' = f(x)$$

We may carry out a **phase-line analysis** to understand the **qualitative behavior** of solutions without even solving the equation
- Sketch the graph at $f(x)$ with its zeros
- Add arrowheads to the x-axis to indicate the sign of f
- Stability of fixed points obtained by inspection

#### Explainations for figures:
These three special solutions are called `equilibria` or **steady states**. 
- If initially, at t = 0, a solution has value 0 (or 1 or 2), it remains so for all times t > 0 
- $x'$ describes the change of $x(t)$ over time: solution x(t) is increasing whenever $f(x) > 0$ and decreasing whenever $f(x) < 0 $
  - See Figure3.2, $x(t)$ is increasing in (0,1) and (2, $\infty$) and decreasing in ($-\infty$,0) and (1,2)
  - Indicate this behavior by adding arrowheads to the x-axis in Figure 3.1
  - E.g. If the initial condition(coule be everywhere when t=0) $x(0)$ is in (0,1), then the solution will grow and converge to x=1 for $t\to\infty$
  
Red Lines in Figure 2.1 are typical solutions to $x' = f(x) = x(1-x)(2-x)$
- The slope is given by f(x), solutions x(t) must have slope x'(t) 
  - Hence solution curves are tangential to thes short arrows in Figure 3.2

[t,x] = meshgrid(t,x);
vx = ones(size(x));

n = sqrt(vx.^2 + vy.^2);

Theoretical Questionï¼š Do the solutions of DE intersect?
  - Answer: Remark 1.
  


### 3.2.1 The Picard-Lindelof Theorem
*Definition 3.1: (Lipschitz Continuous)*

A function $f: D\,\to\,\mathbb{R}$ with domain $D\subset\mathbb{R} $ is called Lipschitz continuous if:
- there is a constant L > 0 such that $|f(x) - f(y)| \leq L|x-y|$ for all $x, y \in D.$

*Theorem 3.2: (Picard-Lindelof)*

Assume the function  $f: D\,\to\,\mathbb{R}$ is Lipschitz continuous. Let the initial condition $x_0$  lie in D. Then there is an $\varepsilon > 0$ such that the IVP(initial value problem): $$\frac{d}{dt}x = f(x) \, x(0) = x_0$$ has a unique solution $x(t)$ for $0\leq t \leq \varepsilon.$

#### Three Remarks
- Although the Thm3.2 is formulated for a small time interval $[0, \varepsilon]$, it implies that solutions to different initial data **never intersect**
- The same result holds true for systems of differential equations which can be written in `vector notation` 
$$
\frac{d}{dt}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1(t)   \\
\vdots \\
x_n(t)\\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
f_1(x_1,...,x_n)\\
\vdots \\
f_n(x_1,...,x_n)\\
\end{pmatrix}$$
In this case, we require that each of the functions $ f_1,...,f_n$ is `Lipschitz continuous` in all of its arguments

- A countinuous differentiable function is always Lipschitz continuous (on a bounded domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}$).
  - Hence as soon as $ f_1,...,f_n$ are differentiable, solutions will **never intersect**
