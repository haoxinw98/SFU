READINGS: SECTION 1.5 - 1.6, 1.10 - 1.11

### 1. System Components (1.5 Resource Management)
#### 1.1 Process Management (1.5.1 & Chapter 3 - 7 )
A process is `a program in execution`. It is a unit of work whin the system.  
- A program is `passive entity`, a process is an `active entity`  
  - A program can do nothing unless its instructions are executed by a CPU

A process needs resources to accomplish its task
- E.g. CPU. memory, I/O devices, files

Process `Termination` will let OS reclaim any `reusable resources`

A single-threaded process has one `program counter` specifying `location` of next instruction to execute
- Processes execute instructions generally `sequentially` until completion

A multi-threaded process has one program counter per thread

Typically a system has many processes(user/operating system) running concurrently on single CPU core by multiplexing or more CPUs cores in parallel

---

The OS is responsible for the following activities in connection with process management
- Process Creation and Deletion
- Process Suspension and Resumption
- Provision of Mechanisms for:
  - Process Synchronization
  - Process Communication
  - Deadlock Handling
---

#### 1.2 Memory Management (1.5.2)
Memory is a large array of words or bytes, each with its own address
- The CPU reads instructions from Main Memory during the `instruction-fetch cycle` and both reads and writes data from main memory during the `data-fetch cycle` 【on a von Neumann Architecture】

Main Memory is a `volatile` storage device
- volatile: everything disappears when power off

The OS is responsible for the following activities in connection with memory management:
- Keep track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom and which parts are free
- Decide which processes to load when memory space becomes available
- Allocate and deallocate memory space as neededd

#### 1.3 File-System Management (1.5.3)
The OS `abstracts` from the physical properties of its storage devices to define a logical storage unit, the `file`
  - The OS maps files onto physical media and accesses these file via the storage devices
  - A file is a collection of related information defined by its creator
  - Files represent programs (both source and object forms) and data
The OS is responsible for the following activities in connection with file management
- File/Directory creation and deletion
- Support of `primitives` for manipulating files and directories
- Access control available on most systems
- Map files onto secondary storage 
- File backup on stable(nonvolatile) storage media
#### 1.4 Secondary (Mass) Storage Management (1.5.4)
Since main memory (primary storage) is volatile and too small to accommodate all data and programs permanently, the computer system must provide `secondary storage` to back up main memory
- Most modern computer systems use disks as the principle storage medium, for both programs and data.

The OS is responsible for the following activities in connection with disk management
- Free Space Management
- Storage Allocation
- Disk Scheduling (only for a hard disk drive【**HDD**】, not solid-state drive【**SSD**】) = **【QUIZ 2!!!!】**
  - Difference: SSDs have no moving parts (physical reason), disk-scheduling algorithms can improve the effective bandwidth of HDDs, average response time, and the variance in response time. In contrast, performance varies little among scheduling algorithms for SSDs.
#### 1.5 Cache Management
Information is normally kept in some storage system (such as main memory)
- as it is used, it is copied into a faster storage system (such as the cache) on a temporary basis.
- putting a copy in the cache under the assumption that we will need it again soon
![storage_levels](imgs/storage_levels.jpeg)

Movement between levels of storage hierarchy can be explicit or implicit
- For instance, data transfer from Cache to CPU and Registers is usually a `hardware function`, W/O OS intervention
- In contrast,transfer of data from disk to memory is usually controlled by the OS

Integer A in file B incremented by 1:
- Magnetic Disk ==> Main Memory ==> Cache ==> Hardware (internal) Register
- where One process executes at a time, A will always be to the copy at the highest level of the hierarchy
- Multitasking Environments must be careful to use most recent updated value of A, no matter where it is stored in the storage hierarchy
- Multiprocessor Environments must provide `Cache Coherency`：
  - Since the various CPUs can all execute in parallel, we must make sure that an update to the value of A in one cache is `immediately reflected` in all other aches where A resides.
- Distributed Environment situation even more complex:
  - Several copies of the same file can be kept on different computers.
  - Since the various copies may be accessed and updated concurrently, some distributed systems ensure that, when a replica is updated in one place, all other replicas are brought up to date ASAP.
#### 1.6 I/O System Management
One purpose of OS is to hide peculiarities of hardware devices from the user  
The I/O subsystem consists of:
- A memory-management componenet that includes `buffering`, `caching`(implicit), and `spooling`
- A general device-driver interface
  - `device driver`: set of interrupt handlers
- Drivers for specific hardware devices

### 2. Protection and Security (1.6)
Protection : any `mechanism` for controlling access of processes or users to resources defined by the OS
- This mechanism must provide means to specify the controls to be imposed and enforce the controls  
Security: defence of the system against internal and external attacks
- denial-of-service（拒绝服务攻击）, worms, viruses, identity theft, etc...  
Systems generally first distinguish among users, to determine who can do what
- User Identities (user IDs, security IDs) include name and associated number, one per user
- User ID then associated with all files, processes of that user to determine access control
- Group Identities (group ID) allows set of users to be defined and controls managed, then also associated with each process, file
- `Privilege Ecalation（特权升级）` allows user to change to effective ID with more rights

### 3. Computing Environments (1.10)
#### 3.1 Traditional Computing
- Stand-alone general-purpose computers
- Range from network computers (thin clients) to powerful laptops/desktops
#### 3.2 Mobile Computing
- Handheld smartphones, tablets, etc
- OS must support many features enabled by sensors (GPS, gyroscope, cameras)
- Allows for new types of apps like AR
#### 3.3 Client-Server Computing
- Dumb terminals supplanted by smart PCs
- Server Systems are responding to requests generated by clients systems
  - `Compute-server system` provides an Interface to client to request services (database)
     - In response, the server executes the action and sends the results to the client
     - E.g. A server running a database that responds to client requests for data
  - `File-server system` provides an Interface for clients to create, update, read, store and retrieve files
     - E.g. Web server that delivers files to clients running web browsers,
#### 3.4 Peer-to-Peer Computing
Another model for a distributed system
P2P does not distinguish clients and servers
- All nodes are considered peers
- May each act as client, server, or both
- Node must join P2P network
  - Registers its service with central lookup service on network, or
  - Broadcast request for service and respond to requests for service via `discovery protocol`
  - 
#### 3.5 Cloud Computing (important)
Delivers computing, storage, and apps as a service across a network
- it's logical extension of `virtualization`, because it uses virtualization as a base for its functionality
  - Amazon EC2(`ElasticComputeCloud`) facility has thousands of servers, millions of Virtual Machines, and petabytes of storage available for use by anyone on the Internet
  - Users pay per month based on how much of those resources they use
Types of CC:
- Public Cloud: a cloud available via the Internet to anyone willing to pay for the services (Dropbox)
- Private Cloud: a cloud run by a company for that company's own use (SFU Vault)
- Hybrid Could: a cloud that includes both public and private cloud components
- SaaS (Software as a Service): one or more apps (word & excel) available via the Internet
- Paas (Platform as a Service): a software stack ready for application use 
- `Load Balancers` spread traffic across many servers
### 4. Open-Source OS
Both Free & Open-source OS are available in `source-code` format rather than as `compiled binary code`.
- Counter to the copy protection and Digital Rights Management (DRM) movement
- Started by Free Software Foundation (FSF), which has "copyleft" `GNU Public License` (GPL)
- Examples include GNU/Linux and BSD UNIX (including core of Mac OS X)
