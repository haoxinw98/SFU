#### Process Concurrency | Race Conditions | Process Creation | The Critical Section Problem
#### Readings: Chapter 3: Processes - sections 3.2 to 3.5 
#### Chapter 6: Synchronization Tools - sections 6.1 to 6.3

### 1. Precedence & Concurrency (优先级和并发 P2 | Section 6.1）
`Logical Concurrency` is achieved on a uni-processor system by quickly switching the CPU from one process to the next
- Two processes which share data, P1 must precede P2
```
P1: A = B + X
P2: D = A * 2
```
- In general, the issues of precedence and concurrency are the same for `logical or physical concurrency`
- When it is Okay for two or more processes to execute concurrently so that we always get consistent results?
  - Depends on what resources are shared between the processes
  
### 2. Race Condition
- Race Condition: When there is a denpendency on the `exact execution order` of statements between two or more processes (different order may lead to different results)
#### 2.1 Read & Write Sets
- A process' read set is the set of `all data in RAM, secondary storage, or other existent data` that a process reads (uses during execution)
  - denoted R(P) for process P
- A process' write set is the set of all data that a process writes (`changes` during execution)
  - dennoted W(P) for process P
#### 2.2 Bernstein's Concurrency Conditions
Used to dictate when two processes are able to execute concurrently, and always produce consistent results
- BCC are as follows: in order for two independent processes P1 and P2 to run concurrently, the folowing 3 conditions must hold:
  - R(P1) cannot intersect W(P2)
  - W(P1) cannot intersect R(P2)
  - W(P1) cannot intersect W(P2)
- If two processe4s does not satisfy BCC, then they are said to have
  - ==> `Critical Section Problem`
  - Critical Sections are the sections of code that `cause violation of BCC`
#### Process Flow Graphs
PFG is a simple directed graph that depicts precedence and concurrency relationships among a group of processes
- The graph is said to be `properly nested` if:
  - it can be described by a simple composition of the process function P and S:
     - P(P1,P2) denotes: a parallel execution of two processes, beginning and ending at the same point in the graph
     - S(P1,P2) denotes: a serial execution of P1 followed by P2
  - Both P & S have only 2 arguments!

- S & P compositions are difficult to read and write, and are unable to describe non-properly nested situations

#### 2.3 Cobegins & Coends Consturct
This is just another way of writing S() and P() functions
- Only works with properly nested graphs
Statement Written between a:
- `cobegin/coend pair` are executed in parallel
- `begin/end pair` are executed in serial, in the order they appear

### 3. Process Creation Constructs (P11 | Section 4.5.2)
- One mechanism for creating processes is called **fork and join**  
- Fork(label L) produces 2 concurrent processes, **one starts immediately after the fork statement, and one starts at `label L (an address)` [example]**
  - Splits a single process into two concurrent processes
- Join(int x) recombines x processes into 1, effectively throwing away the first x-1 processes that reach it, and continuing execution after the `Join statement`, **when the xth process reaches it**

### 4. The Critical Section Problem (P13 | Section 6.2)
#### 4.1 The Critical Section Problem Definition
#### Def of Critical Sections:
- Sections of code in separate processes that do not obey Bernstein's condition
#### Example: Producer / Consumer

#### A solution to the critical section problem must satisfy the following three requirements:
1. Mutually Exclusive:
- If process P<sub>i</sub> is executing in its critical section, then no **other** processes can be executing in **their** critical sections
2. Progress:
- If NO process is executing in its critical section and some processes wish to enter their critical sections, then ONLY THOSE PROCESSES (that are **NOT** executing in their remainder sections) can participate in deciding which will enter its critical section next, and this selection **cannot be postponed indefinitely**
3. Bounded Waiting:
- There exists 【a bound, or limit, on the number of times】 that **other** processes are allowed to enter **their** critical sections **after** a process has made a request to enter its critical section and **before** that request is granted.

#### Quiz2 Question 6  
Which one of the following is **NOT a condition for a solution** to the critical section problem for two processes A and B?
- [ ] A. Process A cannot prevent process B from entering its critical section when A is outside of its critical section (executing in its remainder section)
- [X] B. R(A) cannot intersect with W(B), and W(A) cannot intersect with R(B)
  - Reason: this is part of Bernstein's conditions, if two processes do not satisfy BCC, then they said to have a `critical section problem`, critical sections are the sections of code that cause violation of Bernsteins Concurrency Conditions
- [ ] C. If process A is executing in its critical section, then process B cannot be executing in its critical section
- [ ] D. When A and B try to enter their critical sections at the same time, the decision as to which one gets to go first cannot be postponed indefinitely (Lec05Page17[3])
- [ ] E. All of the above are valid conditions.
