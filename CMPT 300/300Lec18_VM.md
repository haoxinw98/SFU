### 1. Introduction
All memory management strategies have the same goal:
- To Keep many processes in memory simultaneously to allow multiprogramming
- However, they tend to require that an **entire process** be in memory **before** it can execute

Virtual Memory allows the execution of processes that are not completely in memory
- programs can be larger than physical memory of the system!!!

Further, virtual memory **abstracts** main memory into an extremely large, uniform array of storage, separating logical memory as viewed by the programmer from physical memory
- To free programmers from the concerns of memory-storage limitations

#### 1.1 Memory-Management requirement:
- Necessary: The Instructions being executed must be in **physical memory**
- Restriction: Place the **entire** logical address space in physical memory
- Unfortunate: since it limits the size of a program to the size of physical memory ( program < physical memory)

**Dynamic Linking** can help to **ease this restriction**
  - but it requires special precautions (预防）and extra work by the programmer
#### 1.2 Entire Program is not needed at the same time
In many cases, no need to load the entire program into memory:
- Programs often have code to handle unusual error conditions
  - since these errors seldom, if ever, occur in practice, this code is almost never executed
- Arrays, lists, and tables are often allocated more memory than they actually need
- Certain options and features of a program may be used rarely. 
  - For instance, the routines on U.S. government computers that balance the budget have not been used in many years
  
#### 1.3 Benifits
Even in those cases where the entire program is needed,
- it may not all be needed **at the same time**

Execute a program that is only partially in memory confer many benefits:
- A program would no denpend on physical memory
  - Users may write programs for an **extremely large virtual** address space, simplifying the programming task
- Because each program could take less physical memory, more programs could be run at the same time
  - with a corresponding increase in **CPU Utilization** and **throughput**
  - but with no increase in response time or turnaround time
- Less I/O would be needed to load or swap portions of programs into memory, so each program would run faster
#### Overlays
#### Dynamic Loading (9.1.4 & VM W/O Hardware)
With dynamic loading, a routine is not loaded until it is called
- ALl routine are kept on disk in a relocatable load format
- The main program is loaded into memory and is executed
  - when a routine needs to call another routine, the calling routine first checks to see whether the other routine has been loaded
  - If not, **the relocatable linking loader** is called to load the **desired** routine into memory and to update the program's address tables to reflect this change.
    - Then, control is passed to the **newly** loaded routine

The advantage of dynamic loading is that a routine is loaded only when it is needed.
- this method is particularly useful when **large amounts of code** are needed to handle **infrequently** occurring cases, such as error routines. ==> the portion that is used may be much smaller to load

Dynamic loading does not require Hardware Support from the OS
- OS may help programmer by providing library routines to implement dynamic loading
### 2. Demand Page
A demand-paging system is similar to a paging system with swapping (Sec.9.5.2) where processes reside in secondary memory(e.g.HDD) into frames
- Demand Paging explains one of the primary benefits of virtual memory - by loading **only the portions** of programs that are needed, memory is used more efficiently
- Pages (that are never accessed) are thus never loaded into physical memory
