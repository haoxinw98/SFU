May 14，Thursday, 36pages | Reading: Section 1.1 - 1.4 
### 0. Computer Startup
A `bootstrap program` is loaded at power-up or reboot
* Typically stored in ROM or EPROM，generally knowns as *firmware* （固件）
* Initializes all aspects of the system
* Loads operating system kernel and starts execution
### 1. Computer System Organization (1.2)
- One or more CPUs and a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access between components and shared memory.
- Each device controller is in charge of a specific type of device ( e.g. a disk drive, audio device, or graphics display)
  * The device controller is responsible for moving the data between the peripheral devices that it controls and its `local buffer storage`
- OS have `device driver`, for each device controller.
  * device driver understands the device controller and provides the rest of the operating system with a uniform interface to the device.

### 2. Interrupts (Section 1.2.1)
* We want the `I/O devices` and the `CPU` to be able to execute concurrently
  - The CPU should not have to wait for the MUCH slower I/O device
* The I/O device signals an *interrupt* when it is ready
  - alert the CPU to events that require attention
  
* Interrupts must be handled quickly, as they occur very frequently
  - A table of pointers to interrupt routines can be used instead to speed up
  - The table of pointers is stored in low memory, hold the addresses of the interrupt service routines for devices
* When an interrupt occurs, the OS must:
  - Transfer control to the appropriate interrupt handler
  - Since there is more than one device, we use an `interrupt vector`
    * an array of addresses indexed by a unique number given with the interrupt request
    * to provide the address of the interrupt service routine for the interrupting device
#### 2.1 Interrupts: Controllers vs. Handlers
- A `device controller (hardware/firmware)` is responsible for moving data between the media and its own local registers
- An `interrupt handler (software)` is responsible for moving data between the controller registers and memory so it can be accessed by the user program
  - Since there are multiple types of interrupts, there is a handler for each type
#### 2.2 Processing an Interrupt
* 1. User program has control
* 2. I/O interrupt occurs
* 3. User program no longer processed by the CPU
* 4. Control transferred to interrupt handler
* 5. Data transferred from controller to memory or from memory to controller depending on whether input or output operation
* 6. CPU registers restored
* 7. Control returned to user program
### 3. I/O Structure (Sec 1.2.3)
* (from textbook): A large portion of
- The CPU and device controllers operate in parallel
- Two types of I/O operations:
  * synchronous (同步的）： User program waits until I/O operation completes
  * asynchronous(异步的) ： User program allowed to continue while I/O operation is in progress
- Asynchronicity is essential for multiprogramming
- Asynchronous I/O for `program A` allows the CPU to transfer control to another `program B` until I/O for A is complete
#### 3.1 Device Status Table (P9)
- A `device status table` keeps track of which devices are busy, what they are doing for which program, and which programs are waiting for access to devices
#### 3.2 DMA (Direct Memory Access)
- Used for high-speed I/O devices able to transmit information at close to memory speeds
- Device Controller transfers blocks of data from `buffer storage` directly to `main memory` W/O CPU intervention
- Only one interrupt is generated `per block`, rather than one interrupt `per byte/word`
### 4. Storage Structure (Sec1.2.2)
- Bootstrap Program, the first program to run on computer power-on, is hold by EEPROM(electrically erasable programmable read-only memory)
  * EEPROM is low-speed and so it contains mostly static programs and data that aren't frequently used
* Typical (von Neumann) `instruction-execution cycle`
  * Instruction `loaded` from main memory into CPU (registers)
    * Main Memory - only large storage media that the CPU can access directly
  * Instruction decoded
    * May cause other operands to be retrive from memory
  * Instruction executed, repeat
* Secondary Storage - extension of main memory that provides large `nonvolatile` storage capacity

#### 4.1 Magnetic Disks
- Magnetic Disks: Rigid metal or glass platters covered with magnetic recording material
  * Disk Surface is logically divided into tracks, which are subdivided into sectors
  * The Disk Controller determines the logical interaction between the device and the computer

#### 4.2 Solid-State Drives (P14)
- SSD use `NAND Flash` technology
- Bits stored as charges in cells made of transistors （晶体管）
- SLC, MLC, and TLC drives differ in how many bits are stored per cell
- Organization: 8 channels, 4 dies per channel
#### 4.3 Caching (P15)
- Caching is the use of a smaller, but faster, memory system to speed up a bigger, but slower, memory system
  * The cache holds the data `most recently accessed` by the CPU
  * Effective because most programs access the same datat or in
- Cache Management is an important design problem.
  * A well chosen cache size and replacement policy can result in 80+% of all accesses being in the cache
- Problem: Consistency
  * Different Processes must see the same value for a data item

### 5. Types of System
#### 5.1 Mainframe Systems
- Mainframes are large, powerful computers designed to handle large numbers of users and jobs
- The first OS appeared in mainframes
  * Similar jobs batched (批) together to reduce set-up time
  * One job executed at a time ==> No multitasking!
- The OS (monitor) transfers control to the job,when the job is done, control is returned to the OS

#### 5.1.1 Multiprogrammed Batch System
- Several jobs are kept in main memory at the same time, and the CPU is multiplexed among them
- Each job has its own memory space
#### 5.1.2 OS features for Multiprogramming
- I/O routine supplied by the system
- Memory Management
  * The system must allocate memory to several jobs
- CPU scheduling
  * The system must choose among several jobs ready to run
- Allocation of devices (storage devices, etc)

#### 5.2 Desktop Systems
- Personal Computers - computer system dedicated to a single user
- I/O devices - keyboards, mice, monitors, printers
- User Convenience and Responsiveness
- Can adopt technology developed for larger operating systems
  - Usually individuals have sole use of computer and do not need advanced CPU utilization or protection features
- May run several different types of OS ( Windows, Mac OS/X, UNIX, Linux)
#### 5.3 Multiprocessor Systems
- Systems with Multi-Core CPUs
- `Tightly Coupled` system : 
  - processors share memory and a clock
  - Communication between processors through shared memory
- Advantages of parallel system:
  - Increased throughput
  - Economical
  - Increased Reliability
- Types of Multiprocessor Systems
  - Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)
    - Each processor runs an identical copy of the Operating System
    - Many processes can run at once W/O performance deterioration
    - Most modern Operating Systems support SMP
 ![SMP_arch](imgs/SMP_arch.jpeg)
  - Asymmetric Multiprocessing
    - Each processor is assigned a specific task
    - Master processor schedules and allocates work to share processors
  - Dual-core design with two cores on the same chip(processor)

#### 5.4 Distributed Systems
- Another idea is to distribute the computation among several physical processors
- 'Loosely Coupled' System
  - Each processor has its own local memory
  - Processors communicate with one another through communications lines, such as networks (LAN's and WAN's)
    
- Example: Hadoop
  - A Distributed File System(DFS) that manages data and files across distributed computing nodes.
  - The YARN framework, which manages resources within the cluster as well as scheduling tasks on nodes in the cluster
  - The MapReduce system, which allows parallel processing of data across nodes in the cluster
  
#### 5.5 Real-time Systems
- the system that there are well-defined fixed-time constraints
  - things need to happen in a reasonable amount of time and in the correct order
- Example: Robots for manufacturing and Medical divices
#### 5.6 Handheld Systems
- Example: Personal Digital Assistant(PDA) & Smartphones
- Issues when designing handheld Systems 
  - Limited Memory
  - Slower Processor
  - Small Display Screens
  - Limited Input Options (e.g. touch screen)
### 6. OS Structure （1.4.1）
#### 6.1 Multiprogramming
- Needed for efficiency
- A single user cannot keep CPU and I/O devices busy at all times!
- Multiprogramming organizes jobs(code and data) so CPU always has one to execute
- A subset of total jobs in system is kept in memory
  - One job is selected and run via CPU/job scheduling
- When a job has to wait(for I/O like printer), OS switches to another job
#### 6.2 Multitasking(Timesharing)
- Logical extension of multiprogramming in which CPU switches jobs so `frequently` that users can interact with each job while it is running, creating interactive computing
  - Response time should be <1 second (fast)
  - If each user has at least one program executing in memory => Process
  - If several jobs are ready to run at the same time => CPU Scheduling
  - If processes don't fit in memory, swapping moves them in and out to run
  - `Virtual Memory` allows executon of processes not completely in memory (Ch10)
### 7. Dual-Mode Operation (1.4.2)
- Sharing System resources require OS to ensure that an incorrect program cannot cause other programs to execute incorrectly
- `Dual-Mode Operation`: Provide hardware support to differentiate between at least two modes of operations:
  - 1. User Mode: Execution done on behalf of the user
  - 2. Kernel mode (system/privileged/monitor mode): Execution done on behalf of the OS
  - Instruction set is restricted in `user mode` (never modify hardware)
  - A program(user app), running in user mode, attempting to execute a `privileged instruction` (requests a service) via a `system call` will cause a `trap` (= software interrupt) and the system must transition from user mode (bit=1) to kernel mode(bit=0) to `fulfill the request`
  ![mode_trans](imgs/mode_trans.jpeg)
  - System Calls are used to request services from the OS
    - "Give me the current date/time, open a file for reading, print hi on screen"
  - Executing a system call changes mode to kernel, return from call resets it to user
### 8. Hardware Protection
#### 8.1 I/O Protection
- We must ensure that I/O devices are protected as well, to have `I/O protection` we ensure:
  - All I/O instructions are `privileged instructions` (only access via system calls)
- We must also ensure that processes(jobs) are not able to access each other's memory space
  - User jobs must also **not be able** to access the `interrupt handlers` or `interrupt vectors`
#### 8.2 Memory Protection
- In order to have memory protection, add `two registers` that determine `the range of legal addresses` that a program may access
  - Base Register: holds the smallest legal physical memory address
  - Limit Register: contains the size of memory used by the job
#### Hardware Protection - CPU Protection
- We must also ensure that no one job is using up all the CPU cycles
- Timer-in
