## Memory Management | Tues July 7 | Chapter 9.1 | 12 Pages 

### 1. Background (CMPT 295 - ISA & Cache)
Program must be brought (from disk) into memory and placed within a process for it to be run
- Main Memory and Registers are the only storage CPU can access directly
- Access time differs
  - Register access in one CPU clock cycle (or less)
  - Main Memory can take `many cycles`
    - Fetch -> Decode -> Calculate -> Memory -> Write Back
- Cache sits between main memory and CPU Registers for the larger gap between those two.
- Protection of memory required to ensure correct operation
  - To make sure that each process has a `separate memory space`
    - Separate per-process memory space protects  the processes from each other and is fundamental to having multiple processes loaded in memory for concurrent execution
    - To separate memory spaces, need ability to decide 【the range of UNIQUE legal addresses】 that the process may ONLY access
  - By using two Registers loaded only by the OS which uses a special privileged instruction:
    - The Base Register: holds the **smallest legal physical** memory address (300040)
    - The Limit Register: specifies the size of the range (120900)
    - Then the program can legally access all addresses from 300040 through 420939 (inclusive)

### 3. Resident Monitor（ Page5-6 | Appendix2.2）
Memory is divided into 2 parts: 
-
Resident Monitor is a small program created to transfer control automatically from one job to the next. The Resident Monitor is always placed at the top or the bottom of memory.

#### 3.1 Problems with Resident Monitors

### 4. Compiling, Linking and Loading (Page 9 | Section 9.1.2)
- Compiling： Souce-
### 5. Static Relocation (Page 11)
- The `Linker` always generates a module with addresses assuming the module will be loaded at address zero
- 
### 6. Dynamic Relocation (Page 12）
- In this scheme, the linker still generates addresses 【assuming a start position of zero】
