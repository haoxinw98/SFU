  - The system must be able `to load` a program into memory and `to run` that program.

  - A running program may require I/O (reading from a network interface or writing to a file system)
  - Users cannot control I/O devices directly for efficiency and protection 
    - 看上去很严格，其实是为了效率和保护，如果不严格，每个人程序都有出错的可能
    - ==> the OS must provide a means to do I/O
- File-system manipulation
  - read, write, add, delete
