### 1. Duality in Canonical Tableaus
`Definition 1.`
> Any pair of ___ and __ corresponding to thte same tableau as above are said to `exhibit duality` or be `duals` of one another. The tableau of dual canonical linear programming problems is said to be a `dual canonical tableau`

`Definition 2.`
> Let __ be a tableau of a canonical slack minimization linear programming problem. The tableau is said to be minimum basic feasible if Ci <= 0

`Theorem 3.`
> If a canonical maximization linear programming problem has an optimal soluion, then the dual canonical minimization linear programming problem has an optimal solution and vice versa. === Furthermore, dual canonical linear programming problems with optimal solutions have f=g at these solutions.
