## Indicator Variables
### 1. The General Concept of Indicator Variables
* Qualitative Variables: = Categorial variables, Do Not have a scale of measurement
* Indicator Variables: assigns levels to the qualitative variable( also known as dummy variables)
Example: 
y : life of a cutting tool used on lathe to the lathe speed in revolutions
x1
x2: type A: 0 | type B: 1
* Changing from A to B induces a change in the intercept (slope is unchanged and identical).  We assume that the variance is equal for all levels of the qualitative variable.

* For 1 qualitative variables with a levels, we need a-1 indicator variables
