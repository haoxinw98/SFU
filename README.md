> 您将要沉浸在严肃的数学中，着重于对与度量，积分和真实分析有关的定义，定理和证明有深入的了解。本书旨在引导您了解该主题的奇观。  
> You are about to immerse yourself in serious mathematics, with an emphasis on attaining a deep understanding of the definitions, theorems, and proofs related to measure, integration, and real analysis. This book aims to guide you to the wonders of this subject.  
> 您无法像阅读小说一样阅读数学。如果您在不到一个小时的时间内浏览页面，则可能会太快。当您遇到需要验证的词组时，您确实应该进行验证，这通常需要您做一些书面工作。如果遗漏了步骤，则需要提供缺少的部分。您应该考虑并内部化每个定义。对于每个定理，您应该寻找示例来说明为什么每个假设都是必要的。  
> You cannot read mathematics the way you read a novel. If you zip through a page in less than an hour, you are probably going too fast. When you encounter the phrase as you should verify, you should indeed do the verification, which will usually require some writing on your part. When steps are left out, you need to supply the missing pieces. You should ponder and internalize each definition. For each theorem, you should seek examples to show why each hypothesis is necessary.  
> 阅读一节后，完成习题应该是您的主要学习方式。 与其他学生进行讨论和共同努力可能特别有效。 主动学习比被动学习能更好地促进长期了解。 因此，您将可以从练习中挣扎，最终提出解决方案，并与其他学生一起工作，从而从中受益匪浅。 在互联网上查找和阅读解决方案可能会导致学习不足。  
> Working on the exercises should be your main mode of learning after you have read a section. Discussions and joint work with other students may be especially effective. Active learning promotes long-term understanding much better than passive learning. Thus you will benefit considerably from struggling with an exercise and eventually coming up with a solution, perhaps working with other students. Finding and reading a solution on the internet will likely lead to little learning.  
> 数学只能通过做来学习。 幸运的是，真实的分析有很多不错的作业练习。 在教这门课时，我通常在每堂课上 在下一堂课之前，分配几项练习作为家庭作业。 我只给一个评分 练习每套作业，但学生不提前知道哪一个。 我鼓励我的学生一起做家庭作业或寻求帮助。 但是，我告诉他们，不允许从互联网获取解决方案，这会对他们的学习目标产生反作用。  
> Mathematics can be learned only by doing. Fortunately, real analysis has many good homework exercises. When teaching this course, during each class I usually
assign as homework several of the exercises, due the next class. I grade only one exercise per homework set, but the students do not know ahead of time which one. I encourage my students to work together on the homework or to come to me for help. However, I tell them that getting solutions from the internet is not allowed and would be counterproductive for their learning goals.
