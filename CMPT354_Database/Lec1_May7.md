## Database
* What is database?
  * A collection of files that store related data
* We will mainly focus on `relational` databases
  * i.e. Data is stored in tables (表格)
  
  
## Database Management Systems (DBMSs)
* What is DBMS?
  * A piece of `software` designed to store and manage databases
* Examples:
  * Commercial: Oracle, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server
  * Open Source: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
  
## DBMS Functions
* All access to data is `centralized and managed` by the DBMS
* Use advantages:
  * Efficient access
  * Data integrity and security
  * Concurrent access and Concurrency control
* Design and implementation advantages:
  * Logical data independence
  * Physical data independence
  * **Reduced application development time**

## Current Market
* Relational Database still anchor the software industry
* Open Source "NoSQL" is growing
  * Analytics: Hadoop MapReduce, Spark
  * Key-Value Stores: Mongo, Cassandra, Couch
* Cloud Services are expanding quickly

## Course Objectives:
* Master skills to query a database
* Master skills to design a database
* Understand how a DBMS works

## Course Overview:
### Week2. Relational Model
### Week3-4. Structured Query Language (SQL)
* Enable you to communicate with a DBMS
* Declarative language (i.e. say what you want not how to do it)
### Week5. Relational Algebra
* SQL: What you want
* Relational Algebra: How to get it
### Week6. Storage and Indexing
* My database application is too slow... Why?
* One of the queries is very slow... Why?
### Week8. Query Optimization and Execution
* Understand how an SQL query is processed
### Week9-11. Database Design
* How to design a database for an application (e.g. an iPhone APP)
### Week12. Transaction Processing
* What if multiple users access the same data
### Week13. NoSQL & SQL over Hadoop
