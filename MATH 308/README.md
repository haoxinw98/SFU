## Section 1.5 - A Geometric Method for Linear Programming
* Namely that a knowledge of the constraint set of a canonical linear programming problem is `not sufficient to` determine an optimal solution for the problem if the constraint set is unbounded.
  * We must additionally show that the objective function on this set is bounded above in the maximization case or bounded below in the minimization case.
