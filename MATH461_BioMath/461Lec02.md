## Chapter 2 ( Section 2.1 - 2.2.1)
### 2.1 Intro to Discrete-Time Models
Discrete-Time models are appropriate when one can think about the phenomenon in terms of  `discrete time steps` or when one wishes to describe `experimental measurements` that have been collected `at fixed time intervals`.

A sequence of Quantities, x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, x<sub>4</sub>, ……
- where x<sub>i</sub> denotes the quantity at the i<sup>th</sup> measurement of after i time steps
- a discrete model is a rule describing how the quantities change
  - how x<sub>n+1</sub> depends on x<sub>n</sub>
  - x<sub>n+1</sub> = f(x<sub>n</sub>), f is called a map
  - Initial condition x<sub>0</sub>, construct a model to have good agreement with experimental data
